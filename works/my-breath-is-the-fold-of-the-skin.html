<h1>My Breath is the Fold of the Skin</h1>

<div class="info">
  <p><strong>Installation.</strong> Material: Wooden blinds, light</p>
  <p><strong>Size:</strong> 160 × 130 cm</p>
  <p><strong>Time:</strong> 2024</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> What exactly are boundaries? Where do boundaries exist? Where do we truly live? I carved on the blinds in the shape of the folds that formed on my skin after removing a plaster. I am fascinated by this quality of wood — how it transforms white light into red, echoing the red glow I saw as a child when pressing a torchlight to my hand. As I parted the blinds, I noticed how their flowing form mirrored both the folds of skin and the subtle rhythm of breath. As I carved into the blinds, it felt as though I was tracing wounds. The raised patterns began to resemble the faint marks left by nails on skin — ephemeral yet intimate. This resonance deepened my emotional connection with the blinds, as if they had absorbed something of the body.</p>
